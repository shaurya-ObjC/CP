#### Constant
 
 # Do's

 1. Search in project before creating any new constantt
 2. First Priority:- Create constant inside the same class, if that's only used once and keep them at top
 3. Second Priority:- Check the bhaviour of variable whether it can be kept under global constant or Constant + Extension's
 4. Use Enum or Struct for constants?
    Answer:- We Should use case-less enum not Structs

    Because:- The advantage of using a case-less enumeration is that it can't accidentally be instantiated and works as a pure namespace.
        See example:- 
	For e.g:- 
		enum PhysicalConstants {
		    static let speedOfLight = 299_792_458\
		 }
		PhysicalConstants.speedOfLight.

 5. If required you can created nested enum also
 
 # Don't

 1. Create one enum to call all the constants inside it. It's better to divide into differnt different Constants only
    
    enum ConstantK {
           enum DummyControlleer {
               enum EnumConstant {
                   enum Inner {
                       static let iValue = "Inner Value"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
 
 print(ConstantK.DummyControlleer.Inner.iValue)
