Question:- For Constants - Use Enum or Struct?
Answer:-We Should use case-less enum not Structs

Because - The advantage of using a case-less enumeration is that it can't accidentally be instantiated and works as a pure namespace.

For e.g:- 
enum PhysicalConstants {
    static let speedOfLight = 299_792_458\
 }
PhysicalConstants.speedOfLight.
